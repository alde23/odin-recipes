    <h4>The lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made primarily out of dough, tomato sauce and bechamel sauce as well
        as ground meat.</h4>
    <p>
        This classic homemade lasagna recipe features layers of rich meat sauce,
        creamy ricotta cheese, and perfectly cooked pasta,
        all baked to perfection with a golden, bubbly mozzarella topping.
        Start by browning ground beef with onions and garlic, then simmer it with crushed tomatoes,
        tomato paste, and Italian herbs for a deep, savory flavor. Meanwhile, prepare a smooth ricotta mixture by
        blending
        ricotta cheese with an egg, Parmesan, and a touch of nutmeg for extra depth.
        Assemble the lasagna by layering cooked lasagna noodles with the meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and shredded
        mozzarella,
        repeating the layers until the dish is full. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes,
        letting it rest before slicing to allow the flavors to meld beautifully. Serve with a sprinkle of fresh basil
        and a side of garlic bread for a comforting and satisfying meal.
